# TP93 took out of existence persistent item of type

## Domain: 

E64 End of Existence

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E64 End of Existence, _P93 took out of existence (was taken out of existence by)_, E77 Persistent Item, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* volcano eruption destroyed houses

## In First Order Logic: 

TP93(x,y) ⇒ E64(x)
TP93(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP93(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E77(z) ∧ P93(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
