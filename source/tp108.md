# TP108 has produced physical human-made thing of type

## Domain: 

E12 Production

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E12 Production, _P108 has produced (was produced by)_, E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* binding work produced an inboard binding

## In First Order Logic: 

TP108(x,y) ⇒ E12(x)
TP108(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP108(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E24(z) ∧ P108(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
