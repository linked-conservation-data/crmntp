# TP43 has dimension of type

## Domain: 

E70 Thing

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E70 Thing, _P43 has dimension (is dimension of)_, E54 Dimension, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* book has dimension of type radius (for semicircular books)

## In First Order Logic: 

TP43(x,y) ⇒ E70(x)
TP43(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP43(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E54(z) ∧ P43(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
