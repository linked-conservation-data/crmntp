# CRMntp

CRMntp is an extension to the CIDOC-CRM ontology which includes typed and negative typed statements. This allows description of features that do not exist which are otherwise difficult to describe with the CRM.

The repository holds the definitions of the properties under the source directory in separate markdown files.

It also includes a python script which parses these files and produces a docx file according to the current practices of the CRM-SIG for sharing extension documents.
