# TP5 consists of condition state of type

## Domain: 

E3 Condition State

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E3 Condition State, _P5 consists of (forms part of)_, E3 Condition State, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* corroded condition of metal object consists of pitting

## In First Order Logic: 

TP5(x,y) ⇒ E3(x)
TP5(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP5(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E3(z) ∧ P5(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
