# TP121 overlaps with place of type

## Domain: 

E53 Place

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E53 Place, _P121 overlaps with_, E53 Place, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* my village overlaps with a river

## In First Order Logic: 

TP121(x,y) ⇒ E53(x)
TP121(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP121(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E53(z) ∧ P121(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
