# TP157 is at rest relative to physical thing of type

## Domain: 

E53 Place

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E53 Place, _P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for)_, E18 Physical Thing, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* Nelson’s place of death is at rest relative to a ship

## In First Order Logic: 

TP157(x,y) ⇒ E53(x)
TP157(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP157(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E18(z) ∧ P157(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
