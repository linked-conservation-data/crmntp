## Domain: 

E18 Physical Thing

## Range: 

E55 Type

## Superproperty of: 

todo

## Subproperty of: 

todo

## Quantification: 

todo

## Scope note: 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path: E18 Physical Thing, _P46 is composed of (forms part of)_, E18 Physical Thing, _P2 has type_, E55 Type

## Examples: 

* binding is composed of boards

## In First Order Logic: 

TP46(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)
TP46(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
TP46(x,y) ⇔ (∃ z)[E18(z) ∧ P46(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]
